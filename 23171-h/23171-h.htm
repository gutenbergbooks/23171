    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Glmartin was still laughing professionally at the prospective buyer&rsquo;s
      funny story when the telephone on his desk buzzed. He said: &ldquo;Excuse me for
      a minute, old man,&rdquo; to the customer&mdash;Hopkins, the Connecticut
      manufacturer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello; who is this?&rdquo; he spoke into the transmitter. &ldquo;Oh, how are you?&mdash;Yes&mdash;I
      was out&mdash;Is that so?&mdash;Too bad&mdash;Too bad&mdash;Yes; just my
      luck to be out. I might have known it!&mdash;Do you think so?&mdash;Well,
      then, sell the 200 Occidental common&mdash;You know best&mdash;What about
      Trolley?&mdash;Hold on?&mdash;All right; just as you say&mdash;I hope so&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t like to lose, and&mdash;Ha! ha!&mdash;I guess so&mdash;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from my brokers,&rdquo; explained Gilmartin, hanging up the receiver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      have saved five hundred dollars if I had been here at half-past ten. They
      called me up to advise me to sell out, and the price is off over three
      points. I could have got out at a profit this morning; but no, sir; not I.
      I had to be away, trying to buy some camphor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hopkins was impressed. Gilmartin perceived it and went on, with an air of
      comical wrath which he thought was preferable to indifference: &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
      the money I mind so much as the tough luck of it. I didn&rsquo;t make my trade
      in camphor after all and I lost in stocks, when if I&rsquo;d only waited five
      minutes more in the office I&rsquo;d have got the message from my brokers and
      saved my five hundred. Expensive, my time is, eh?&rdquo; with a woful shake of
      the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re ahead of the game, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked the customer,
      interestedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess yes. Just about twelve thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was more than Gilmartin had made; but having exaggerated, he
      immediately felt very kindly disposed toward the Connecticut man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled Hopkins, admiringly. Gilmartin experienced a great
      tenderness toward him. The lie was made stingless by the customer&rsquo;s
      credulity. This brought a smile of subtle relief to Gilmartin&rsquo;s lips. He
      was a pleasant-faced, pleasant-voiced man of three-and-thirty. He exhaled
      health, contentment, neatness, and an easy conscience. Honesty and
      good-nature shone in his eyes. People liked to shake hands with him. It
      made his friends talk of his lucky star; and they envied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bought this yesterday for my wife; took it out of a little deal in
      Trolley,&rdquo; he told Hopkins, taking a small jewel-box from one of the desk&rsquo;s
      drawers. It contained a diamond ring, somewhat showy, but obviously quite
      expensive. Hopkins&rsquo;s semi-envious admiration made Gilmartin add, genially:
      &ldquo;What do you say to lunch? I feel I am entitled to a glass of &lsquo;fizz&rsquo; to
      forget my bad luck of this morning.&rdquo; Then, in an exaggeratedly apologetic
      tone: &ldquo;Nobody likes to lose five hundred dollars on an empty stomach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be delighted, of course,&rdquo; said Hopkins, thinking of Mrs.
      Gilmartin. Mrs. Hopkins loved jewelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the nicest little woman that ever lived. Whatever is mine is hers;
      and what&rsquo;s hers is her own. Ha! ha! But,&rdquo; becoming nicely serious, &ldquo;all
      that I&rsquo;ll make out of the stock market I&rsquo;m going to put away for her, in
      her name. She can take better care of it than I; and, besides, she&rsquo;s
      entitled to it, anyhow, for being so nice to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is how he told what a good husband he was. He felt so pleased over it
      that he went on, sincerely regretful: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s visiting friends in
      Pennsylvania or I&rsquo;d ask you to dine with us.&rdquo; And they went to a
      fashionable restaurant together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day Gilmartin thought persistently that Maiden Lane was too far
      from Wall Street. There came a week in which he could have made four very
      handsome &ldquo;turns&rdquo; had he but been in the brokers&rsquo; office. He was out on
      business for his firm and when he returned the opportunity had gone,
      leaving behind it vivid visions of what might have been; also the
      conviction that time, tide, and the ticker wait for no man. Instead of
      buying and selling quinine and balsams and essential oils for Maxwell
      &amp; Kip, drug brokers and importers, he decided to make the buying and
      selling of stocks and bonds his exclusive business. The hours were easy;
      the profits would be great. He would make enough to live on. He would not
      let the Street take away what it had given. That was the great secret: to
      know when to quit! He would be content with a moderate amount, wisely
      invested in gilt-edged bonds. And then he would bid the Street good-by
      forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Force of long business custom and the indefinable fear of new ventures for
      a time fought successfully his increasing ticker-fever. But one day his
      brokers wished to speak to him, to urge him to sell out his entire
      holdings, having been advised of an epoch-making resolution by Congress.
      They had received the news in advance from a Washington customer. Other
      brokers had important connections in the Capital and therefore there was
      no time to lose. They dared not assume the responsibilty of selling him
      out without his permission. Five minutes&mdash;five eternities!&mdash;passed
      before they could talk by telephone with him; and when he gave his order
      to sell, the market had broken five or six points. The news was &ldquo;out.&rdquo; The
      news agencies&rsquo; slips were in the brokers&rsquo; offices and half of Wall Street
      knew. Instead of being among the first ten sellers Gilmartin was among the
      second hundred.

      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The clerks gave him a farewell dinner. All were there, even the head
      office-boy to whom the two-dollar subscription was no light matter. The
      man who probably would succeed Gilmartin as manager, Jenkins, acted as
      toastmaster. He made a witty speech which ended with a neatly turned
      compliment. Moreover, he seemed sincerely sorry to bid good-by to the man
      whose departure meant promotion&mdash;which was the nicest compliment of
      all. And the other clerks&mdash;old Williamson, long since ambition-proof;
      and young Hardy, bitten ceaselessly by it; and middle-aged Jameson, who
      knew he could run the business much better than Gilmartin; and Baldwin,
      who never thought of business in or out of the office&mdash;all told him
      how good he had been and related corroborative anecdotes that made him
      blush and the others cheer; and how sorry they were he would no longer be
      with them, but how glad he was going to do so much better by himself; and
      they hoped he would not &ldquo;cut&rdquo; them when he met them after he had become a
      great millionaire. And Gilmartin felt his heart grow soft and feelings not
      all of happiness came over him. Danny, the dean of the office boys, whose
      surname was known only to the cashier, rose and said, in the tones of one
      speaking of a dear departed friend: &ldquo;He was the best man in the place. He
      always was all right.&rdquo; Everybody laughed; whereupon Danny went on, with a
      defiant glare at the others: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d work for him for nothin&rsquo; if he&rsquo;d want
      me, instead of gettin&rsquo; ten a week from any one else.&rdquo; And when they
      laughed the harder at this he said, stoutly: &ldquo;Yes, I would!&rdquo; His eyes
      filled with tears at their incredulity, which he feared might be shared by
      Mr. Gilmartin. But the toastmaster rose very gravely and said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      matter with Danny?&rdquo; And all shouted in unison: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; with a
      cordiality so heartfelt that Danny smiled and sat down, blushing happily.
      And crusty Jameson, who knew he could run the business so much better than
      Gilmartin, stood up&mdash;he was the last speaker&mdash;and began: &ldquo;In the
      ten years I&rsquo;ve worked with Gilmartin, we&rsquo;ve had our differences and&mdash;well&mdash;I&mdash;well&mdash;er&mdash;oh,
      damn it!&rdquo; and walked quickly to the head of the table and shook hands
      violently with Gilmartin for fully a minute, while all the others looked
      on in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilmartin had been eager to go to Wall Street. But this leave-taking made
      him sad. The old Gilmartin who had worked with these men was no more and
      the new Gilmartin felt sorry. He had never stopped to think how much they
      cared for him nor indeed how very much he cared for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told them, very simply, he did not expect ever again to spend such
      pleasant years anywhere as at the old office; and as for his spells of
      ill-temper&mdash;oh, yes, they needn&rsquo;t shake their heads; he knew he often
      was irritable&mdash;he had meant well and trusted they would forgive him.
      If he had his life to live over again he would try really to deserve all
      that they had said of him on this evening. And he was very, very sorry to
      leave them. &ldquo;Very sorry, boys; very sorry. <i>Very</i> sorry!&rdquo; he finished
      lamely, with a wistful smile. He shook hands with each man&mdash;a strong
      grip, as though he were about to go on a journey from which he might never
      return&mdash;and in his heart of hearts there was a new doubt of the
      wisdom of going to Wall Street. But it was too late to draw back.
    </p>
    <p>
      They escorted him to his house. They wished to be with him to the last
      possible minute.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Everybody in the drug trade seemed to think that Gilmartin was on the
      highroad to Fortune. Those old business acquaintances and former
      competitors whom he happened to meet in the street-cars or in the theatre
      lobbies always spoke to him as to a millionaire-to-be, in what they
      imagined was correct Wall Street jargon, to show him that they too knew
      something of the great game. But their efforts made him smile with a sense
      of superiority, at the same time that their admiration for his cleverness
      and their good-natured envy for his luck made his soul thrill joyously.
      Among his new friends in Wall Street also he found much to enjoy. The
      other customers&mdash;some of them very wealthy men&mdash;listened to his
      views regarding the market as attentively as he, later, felt it his polite
      duty to listen to theirs. The brokers themselves treated him as a &ldquo;good
      fellow.&rdquo; They cajoled him into trading often&mdash;every one hundred
      shares he bought or sold meant $12.50 to them&mdash;and when he won, they
      praised his unerring discernment. When he lost they soothed him by
      scolding him for his recklessness&mdash;just as a mother will treat her
      three-year-old&rsquo;s fall as a great joke in order to deceive the child into
      laughing at its misfortune. It was an average office with an average
      clientèle.
    </p>
    <p>
      From ten to three they stood before the quotation board and watched a
      quick-witted boy chalk the price changes, which one or another of the
      customers read aloud from the tape as it came from the ticker. The higher
      stocks went the more numerous the customers became, being allured in great
      flocks to the Street by the tales of their friends, who had profited
      greatly by the rise. All were winning, for all were buying stocks in a
      bull market. They resembled each other marvelously, these men who differed
      so greatly in cast of features and complexion and age. Life to all of them
      was full of joy. The very ticker sounded mirthful; its clicking told of
      golden jokes. And Gilmartin and the other customers laughed heartily at
      the mildest of stories without even waiting for the point of the joke. At
      times their fingers clutched the air happily, as if they actually felt the
      good money the ticker was presenting to them. They were all neophytes at
      the great game&mdash;lambkins who were bleating blithely to inform the
      world what clever and formidable wolves they were. Some of them had
      sustained occasional losses; but these were trifling compared with their
      winnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the slump came all were heavily committed to the bull side. It was a
      bad slump. It was so unexpected&mdash;by the lambs&mdash;that all of them
      said, very gravely, it came like a thunderclap out of a clear sky. While
      it lasted, that is, while the shearing of the flock was proceeding, it was
      very uncomfortable. Those same joyous, winning stock-gamblers, with
      beaming faces, of the week before, were fear-clutched, losing
      stock-gamblers, with livid faces, on what they afterward called the day of
      the panic. It really was only a slump; rather sharper than usual. Too many
      lambs had been over-speculating. The wholesale dealers in securities&mdash;and
      insecurities&mdash;held very little of their own wares, having sold them
      to the lambs, and wanted them back now&mdash;cheaper. The customers&rsquo; eyes,
      as on happier days, were intent on the quotation board. Their dreams were
      rudely shattered; the fast horses some had all but bought joined the steam
      yachts others almost had chartered. The beautiful homes they had been
      building were torn down in the twinkling of an eye. And the demolisher of
      dreams and dwellings was the ticker, that instead of golden jokes was now
      clicking financial death. They could not take their eyes from the board
      before them. Their own ruin, told in mournful numbers by the little
      machine, fascinated them. To be sure, poor Gilmartin said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed
      my mind about Newport. I guess I&rsquo;ll spend the summer on my own <i>Hotel de
      Roof!</i>&rdquo; And he grinned; but he grinned alone. Wilson, the dry goods
      man, who laughed so joyously at everybody&rsquo;s jokes, was now watching, as if
      under a hypnotic spell, the lips of the man who sat on the high stool
      beside the ticker and called out the prices to the quotation boy. Now and
      again Wilson&rsquo;s own lips made curious grimaces, as if speaking to himself.
      Brown, the slender, pale-faced man, was outside in the hall, pacing to and
      fro. All was lost, including honor. And he was afraid to look at the
      ticker, afraid to hear the prices shouted, yet hoping&mdash;for a miracle!
      Gil-martin came out from the office, saw Brown and said, with sickly
      bravado: &ldquo;I held out as long as I could. But they got <i>my</i> ducats. A
      sporting life comes high, I tell you!&rdquo; But Brown did not heed him, and
      Gilmartin pushed the elevator button impatiently and cursed at the delay.
      He not only had lost the &ldquo;paper&rdquo; profits he had accumulated during the
      bull market, but all his savings of years had crumbled away beneath the
      strokes of the ticker that day. It was the same with all. They would not
      take a small loss at first, but had held on, in the hope of a recovery
      that would &ldquo;let them out even.&rdquo; And prices had sunk and sunk until the
      loss was so great that it seemed only proper to hold on, if need be a
      year, for sooner or later prices must come back. But the break &ldquo;shook them
      out,&rdquo; and prices went just so much lower because so many people had to
      sell whether they would or not.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the slump most of the customers returned to their legitimate
      business&mdash;sadder, but it is to be feared not much wiser men.
      Gilmartin, after the first numbing shock, tried to learn of fresh
      opportunities in the drug business. But his heart was not in his search.
      There was the shame of confessing defeat in Wall Street so soon after
      leaving Maiden Lane; but far stronger than this was the effect of the
      poison of gambling. If it was bad enough to be obliged to begin lower than
      he had been at Maxwell &amp; Kip&rsquo;s, it was worse to condemn himself to
      long weary years of work in the drug business when his reward, if he
      remained strong and healthy, would consist merely in being able to save a
      few thousands. But a few lucky weeks in the stock market would win him
      back all he had lost&mdash;and more!
    </p>
    <p>
      He should have begun in a small way while he was learning to speculate. He
      saw it now very clearly. Every one of his mistakes had been due to
      inexperience. He had imagined he knew the market. But it was only now that
      he really knew it, and therefore it was only now, after the slump had
      taught him so much, that he could reasonably hope to succeed. His mind,
      brooding over his losses, definitely dismissed as futile the resumption of
      the purchase and sale of drugs, and dwelt persistently on the sudden
      acquisition of stock market wisdom. Properly applied, this wisdom ought to
      mean much to him. In a few weeks he was again spending his days before the
      quotation board, gossiping with those customers who had survived, giving
      and receiving advice. And as time passed the grip of Wall Street on his
      soul grew stronger until it strangled all other aspirations. He could
      talk, think, dream of nothing but stocks. He could not read the newspapers
      without thinking how the market would &ldquo;take&rdquo; the news contained therein.
      If a huge refinery burned down, with a loss to the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo; of $4,000,000,
      he sighed because he had not foreseen the catastrophe and had sold Sugar
      short. If a strike by the men of the Suburban Trolley Company led to
      violence and destruction of life and property, he cursed an unrelenting
      Fate because he had not had the prescience to &ldquo;put out&rdquo; a thousand shares
      of Trolley. And he constantly calculated to the last fraction of a point
      how much money he would have made if he had sold short just before the
      calamity at the very top prices and had covered his stock at the bottom.
      Had he only known! The atmosphere of the Street, the odor of speculation
      surrounded him on all sides, enveloped him like a fog, from which the
      things of the outside world appeared as though seen through a veil. He
      lived in the district where men do not say &ldquo;Good-morning&rdquo; on meeting one
      another, but &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the market?&rdquo; or, when one asks: &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo;
       receives for an answer: &ldquo;Bullish!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bearish!&rdquo; instead of a reply
      regarding the state of health.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, after the fatal slump, Gilmartin importuned his brokers to let
      him speculate on credit, in a small way. They did. They were kindly enough
      men and sincerely wished to help him. But luck ran against him. With the
      obstinacy of unsuperstitious gamblers he insisted on fighting Fate. He was
      a bull in a bear market; and the more he lost the more he thought the
      inevitable &ldquo;rally&rdquo; in prices was due. He bought in expectation of it and
      lost again and again, until he owed the brokers a greater sum than he
      could possibly pay; and they refused point blank to give him credit for
      another cent, disregarding his vehement entreaties to buy a last hundred,
      just one more chance, the last, because he would be sure to win. And, of
      course, the long-expected happened and the market went up with a rapidity
      that made the Street blink; and Gilmartin figured that had not the brokers
      refused his last order, he would have made enough to pay off the
      indebtedness and have left, in addition, $2,950; for he would have
      &ldquo;pyramided&rdquo; on the way up. He showed the brokers his figures, accusingly,
      and they had some words about it and he left the office, almost tempted to
      sue the firm for conspiracy with intent to defraud; but decided that it
      was &ldquo;another of Luck&rsquo;s sockdolagers&rdquo; and let it go at that, gambler-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to the brokers&rsquo; office&mdash;the next day&mdash;he began
      to speculate in the only way he could&mdash;vicariously. Smith, for
      instance, who was long of 500 St. Paul at 125, took less interest in the
      deal than did Gilmartin, who thenceforth assiduously studied the news
      slips and sought information on St. Paul all over the Street, listening
      thrillingly to tips and rumors regarding the stock, suffering keenly when
      the price declined, laughing and chirruping blithely if the quotations
      moved upward, exactly as though it were his own stock. In a measure it was
      as an anodyne to his ticker fever. Indeed, in some cases his interest was
      so poignant and his advice so frequent&mdash;he would speak of <i>our</i>
      deal&mdash;that the lucky winner gave him a small share of his spoils,
      which Gilmartin accepted without hesitation&mdash;he was beyond
      pride-wounding by now&mdash;and promptly used to back some miniature deal
      of his own on the Consolidated Exchange or even in &ldquo;Percy&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;a dingy
      little bucket shop, where they took orders for two shares of stock on a
      margin of 1 per cent; that is, where a man could bet as little as two
      dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, it often came to pass that Gilmartin would borrow a few dollars
      when the customers were not trading actively. The amounts he borrowed
      diminished by reason of the increasing frequency of their refusals.
      Finally, he was asked to stay away from the office where once he had been
      an honored and pampered customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became a Wall Street &ldquo;has been&rdquo; and could be seen daily on New Street,
      back of the Consolidated Exchange, where the &ldquo;put&rdquo; and &ldquo;call&rdquo; brokers
      congregate. The tickers in the saloons nearby fed his gambler&rsquo;s appetite.
      From time to time luckier men took him into the same be-tickered saloons,
      where he ate at the free lunch counters and drank beer and talked stocks
      and listened to the lucky winners&rsquo; narratives with lips tremulous with
      readiness to smile and grimace. At times the gambler in him would assert
      itself and he would tell the lucky winners, wrathfully, how the stock he
      wished to buy but couldn&rsquo;t the week before had risen 18 points. But they,
      saturated with their own ticker fever, would nod absently, their soul&rsquo;s
      eyes fixed on some quotation-to-be; or they would not nod at all, but in
      their eagerness to look at the tape, from which they had been absent two
      long minutes, would leave him without a single word of consolation or even
      of farewell.

    <h2>
      V
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day, in New Street, he overheard a very well-known broker tell another
      that Mr. Sharpe was &ldquo;going to move up Pennsylvania Central right away.&rdquo;
       The overhearing of the conversation was a bit of rare good luck that
      raised Gil-martin from his sodden apathy and made him hasten to his
      brother-in-law, who kept a grocery store in Brooklyn. He implored Griggs
      to go to a broker and buy as much Pennsylvania Central as he could&mdash;that
      is, if he wished to live in luxury the rest of his life. Sam Sharpe was
      going to put it up. Also, he borrowed ten dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Griggs was tempted. He debated with himself many hours, and at length
      yielded with misgivings. He took his savings and bought one hundred shares
      of Pennsylvania Central at 64, and began to neglect his business in order
      to study the financial pages of the newspapers. Little by little
      Gilmartin&rsquo;s whisper set in motion within him the wheels of a ticker that
      printed on his day-dreams the mark of the dollar. His wife, seeing him
      preoccupied, thought business was bad; but Griggs denied it, confirming
      her worst fears. Finally, he had a telephone put in his little shop, to be
      able to talk to his broker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilmartin, with the ten dollars he had borrowed, promptly bought ten
      shares in a bucket shop at 63%; the stock promptly went to 62%; he was
      promptly &ldquo;wiped&rdquo;; and the stock promptly went back to 64%.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day a fellow-customer of Gilmartin of old days invited him to
      have a drink. Gil-martin resented the man&rsquo;s evident prosperity. He felt
      indignant at the ability of the other to buy hundreds of shares. But the
      liquor soothed him, and in a burst of mild remorse he told Smithers, after
      an apprehensive look about him as if he feared some one might overhear:
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something, on the dead q. t., for your own benefit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pa. Cent, is going &lsquo;way up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Smithers, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it will cross par sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; between munches of a pretzel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Sam Sharpe told&rdquo;&mdash;Gilmartin was on the point of saying a
      &ldquo;friend of mine,&rdquo; but caught himself and went on, impressively&mdash;&ldquo;told
      me, yesterday, to buy Pa. Cent., as he had accumulated his full line, and
      was ready to whoop it up. And you know what Sharpe is,&rdquo; he finished, as if
      he thought Smithers was familiar with Sharpe&rsquo;s powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so,&rdquo; nibbled Smithers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, when Sharpe makes up his mind to put up a stock, as he intends to do
      with Pa. Cent., nothing on earth can stop him. He told me he would make it
      cross par within sixty days. This is no hearsay, no tip. It&rsquo;s cold facts,
      I don&rsquo;t <i>hear</i> it&rsquo;s going up; I don&rsquo;t <i>think</i> it&rsquo;s going up; I
      <i>know</i> it&rsquo;s going up. Understand?&rdquo; And he shook his right forefinger
      with a hammering motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than five minutes Smithers was so wrought up that he bought 500
      shares and promised solemnly not to &ldquo;take his profits,&rdquo; s. o. sell out,
      until Gilmartin said the word. Then they had another drink and another
      look at the ticker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to keep in touch with me,&rdquo; was Gilmartin&rsquo;s parting shot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what Sharpe tells me. But you must keep it quiet,&rdquo; with a
      sidewise nod that pledged Smithers to honorable secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Gilmartin met Sharpe face to face, he would not have known who was
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after he left Smithers he buttonholed another acquaintance, a
      young man who thought he knew Wall Street, and therefore had a hobby&mdash;manipulation.
      No one could induce him to buy stocks by telling him how well the
      companies were doing, how bright the prospects, etc. That was bait for
      &ldquo;suckers,&rdquo; not for clever young stock operators. But any one, even a
      stranger, who said that &ldquo;they&rdquo;&mdash;the perennially mysterious &ldquo;they,&rdquo;
       the &ldquo;big men,&rdquo; the mighty &ldquo;manipulators&rdquo; whose life was one prolonged
      conspiracy to pull the wool over the public&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;&ldquo;they&rdquo; were going
      to &ldquo;jack up&rdquo; these or the other shares, was welcomed and his advice acted
      upon. Young Freeman believed in nothing but &ldquo;their&rdquo; wickedness and &ldquo;their&rdquo;
       power to advance or depress stock values at will. Thinking of his wisdom
      had given him a chronic sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the man I was looking for,&rdquo; said Gilmartin, who hadn&rsquo;t
      thought of the young man at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a deputy sheriff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; A slight pause for oratorical effect. &ldquo;I had a long talk with Sam
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sharpe. The old boy sent for me. He was in mighty good humor too. Tickled
      to death. He might well be&mdash;he&rsquo;s got 60,000 shares of Pennsylvania
      Central. And there&rsquo;s going to be from 50 to 60 points profit in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; sniffed Freeman, sceptically, yet impressed by the change In
      Gilmartin&rsquo;s attitude from the money-borrowing humility of the previous
      week to the confident tone of a man with a straight tip. Sharpe was
      notoriously kind to his old friends&mdash;rich or poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there when the papers were signed,&rdquo; Gilmartin said, hotly. &ldquo;I was
      going to leave the room, but Sam told me I needn&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t tell you what
      it is about; really I can&rsquo;t. But he&rsquo;s simply going to put the stock above
      par. It&rsquo;s 64 1/2 now, and you know and I know that by the time it is 75
      the newspapers will all be talking about inside buying; and at 85
      everybody will want to buy it on account of important developments; and at
      95 there will be millions of bull tips on it and rumors of increased
      dividends, and people who would not look at it thirty points lower will
      rush in and buy it by the bushel. Let me know who is manipulating a stock,
      and to h&mdash;l with dividends and earnings. Them&rsquo;s <i>my</i>
      sentiments,&rdquo; with a final hammering nod, as if driving in a profound
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; assented Freeman, cordially. He was attacked on his
      vulnerable side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange things happen in Wall Street. Sometimes tips come true. It so
      proved in this case. Sharpe started the stock upward brilliantly&mdash;the
      movement became historic in the Street&mdash;and Pa. Cent, soared dizzily
      and all the newspapers talked of it and the public went mad over it and it
      touched 80 and 85 and 88 and higher, and then Gilmartin made his
      brother-in-law sell out and Smithers and Freeman. Their profits were:
      Griggs, $8,000; Smithers, $15,100; Freeman, $2,750. Gilmartin made them
      give him a good percentage. He had no trouble with his brother-in-law.
      Gilmartin told him it was an inviolable Wall Street custom and so Griggs
      paid, with an air of much experience in such matters. Freeman was more or
      less grateful. But Smithers met Gilmartin, and full of his good luck
      repeated what he had told a dozen men within the hour: &ldquo;I did a dandy
      stroke the other day. Pa. Cent. looked to me like higher prices and I
      bought a wad of it. I&rsquo;ve cleaned up a tidy sum,&rdquo; and he looked proud of
      his own penetration. He really had forgotten that it was Gilmartin who had
      given him the tip. But not so Gilmartin, who retorted, witheringly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve often heard of folks that you put into good things and they
      make money and afterward they come to you and tell how damned smart they
      were to hit it right. But you can&rsquo;t work that on me. I&rsquo;ve got witnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Witnesses?&rdquo; echoed Smithers, looking cheap. He remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, wit-ness-es,&rdquo; mimicked Gilmartin, scornfully, &ldquo;I all but had to get
      on my knees to make you buy it. And I told you when to sell it, too. The
      information came to me straight from headquarters and you got the use of
      it, and now the least you can do is to give me twenty-five hundred
      dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the end he accepted eight hundred dollars. He told mutual friends that
      Smithers had cheated him.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It seemed as though the regeneration of Gilmartin had been achieved when
      he changed his shabby raiment for expensive clothes. He paid his
      tradesmen&rsquo;s bills and moved into better quarters. He spent his money as
      though he had made millions. One week after he had closed out the deal his
      friends would have sworn Gilmartin had always been prosperous. That was
      his exterior. His inner self remained the same&mdash;a gambler. He began
      to speculate again, in the office of Freeman&rsquo;s brokers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the second month he had lost not only the $1,200 he had
      deposited with the firm, but an additional $250 he had given his wife and
      had been obliged to &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; back from her, despite her assurances that he
      would lose it. This time the slump was really unexpected by all, even by
      the magnates&mdash;the mysterious and all-powerful &ldquo;they&rdquo; of Freeman&rsquo;s&mdash;so
      that the loss of the second fortune did not reflect on Gilmartin&rsquo;s ability
      as a speculator, but on his luck. As a matter of fact, he had been too
      careful and had sinned from over-timidity at first, only to plunge later
      and lose all.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the result of much thought about his losses Gilmartin became a
      professional tipster. To let others speculate for him seemed the only sure
      way of winning. He began by advising ten victims&mdash;he learned in time
      to call them clients&mdash;to sell Steel Rod preferred, each man 100
      shares; and to a second ten he urged the purchase of the same quantity of
      the same stock. To all he advised taking four points&rsquo; profit. Not all
      followed his advice, but the seven clients who sold it made between them
      nearly $3,000 overnight. His percentage amounted to $287.50. Six bought,
      and when they lost he told them confidentially how the treachery of a
      leading member of the pool had obliged the pool managers to withdraw their
      support from the stock temporarily, whence the decline. They grumbled; but
      he assured them that he himself had lost nearly $1,600 of his own on
      account of the traitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some months Gilmartin made a fair living, but business became very
      dull. People learned to fight shy of his tips. The persuasiveness was gone
      from his inside news and from his confidential advice from Sharpe and from
      his beholding with his own eyes the signing of epoch-making documents. Had
      he been able to make his customers alternate their winnings and losses he
      might have kept his trade. But, for example, &ldquo;Dave&rdquo; Rossiter, in Stuart
      &amp; Stern&rsquo;s office, stupidly received the wrong tip six times in
      succession. It wasn&rsquo;t Gilmartin&rsquo;s fault, but Rossiter&rsquo;s bad luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, failing to get enough clients in the ticker district itself,
      Gilmartin was forced to advertise in an afternoon paper, six times a week,
      and in the Sunday edition of one of the leading morning dailies. They ran
      like this:

      He prospered amazingly. Answers came to him from furniture dealers on
      Fourth Avenue and dairymen up the State and fruit growers in Delaware and
      factory workers in Massachusetts and electricians in New Jersey and coal
      miners in Pennsylvania and shopkeepers and physicians and plumbers and
      undertakers in towns and cities near and far. Every morning Gilmartin
      telegraphed to scores of people&mdash;at their expense&mdash;to sell, and
      to scores of others to buy the same stocks. And he claimed his commissions
      from the winners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little his savings grew; and with them grew his desire to
      speculate on his own account. It made him irritable not to gamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met Freeman one day in one of his dissatisfied moods. Out of politeness
      he asked the young cynic the universal query of the Street:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of &lsquo;em?&rdquo; He meant stocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does it make what I think?&rdquo; sneered Freeman, with proud
      humility. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nobody.&rdquo; But he looked as if he did not agree with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you <i>know?</i>&rdquo; pursued Gilmartin mollifyingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know enough to be long of Gotham Gas. I just bought a thousand shares
      at 180.&rdquo; He really had bought a hundred only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On information. I got it straight from a director of the company. Look
      here, Gilmartin, I&rsquo;m pledged to secrecy. But, for your own benefit, I&rsquo;ll
      just tell you to buy all the Gas you possibly can carry. The deal is on. I
      know that certain papers were signed last night, and they are almost ready
      to spring it on the public. They haven&rsquo;t got all the stock they want. When
      they get it, look out for fireworks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gilmartin did not perceive any resemblance between Freeman&rsquo;s tips and his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, hesitatingly, as though ashamed of his timidity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stock seems pretty high at 180.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t think so when it sells at 250. Gilmartin, I don&rsquo;t <i>hear</i>
      this; I don&rsquo;t <i>think</i> it; I <i>know</i> it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;m in,&rdquo; quoth Gilmartin, jovially. He felt a sense of
      emancipation now that he had made up his mind to resume his speculating.
      He took every cent of the nine hundred dollars he had made from telling
      people the same things that Freeman told him now, and bought a hundred
      Gotham Gas at $185 a share. Also he telegraphed to all his clients to
      plunge in the stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fluctuated between 184 and 186 for a fortnight. Freeman daily
      asseverated that &ldquo;they&rdquo; were accumulating the stock. But, one fine day,
      the directors met, agreed that business was bad, and having sold out most
      of their own holdings, decided to reduce the dividend rate from 8 to 6 per
      cent. Gotham Gas broke seventeen points in ten short minutes. Gilmartin
      lost all he had. He found it impossible to pay for his advertisements. The
      telegraph companies refused to accept any more &ldquo;collect&rdquo; messages. This
      deprived Gilmartin of his income as a tipster. Griggs had kept on
      speculating and had lost all his money and his wife&rsquo;s in a little deal in
      Iowa Midland. All that Gilmartin could hope to get from him was an
      occasional invitation to dinner. Mrs. Gilmartin, after they were
      dispossessed for non-payment of rent, left her husband, and went to live
      with a sister in Newark who did not like Gilmartin.

    <p>
      His clothes became shabby and his meals irregular. But always in his
      heart, as abiding as an inventor&rsquo;s faith in himself, there dwelt the hope
      that some day, somehow, he would &ldquo;strike it rich&rdquo; in the stock market.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he borrowed five dollars from a man who had made five thousand in
      Cosmopolitan Traction. The stock, the man said, had only begun to go up,
      and Gilmartin believed it and bought five shares in &ldquo;Percy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; his
      favorite bucket shop. The stock began to rise slowly but steadily. The
      next afternoon &ldquo;Percy&rsquo;s&rdquo; was raided, the proprietor having disagreed with
      the police as to price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilmartin lingered about New Street, talking with other customers of the
      raided bucket shop, discussing whether or not it was a &ldquo;put up job&rdquo; of old
      Percy himself, who, it was known, had been losing money to the crowd for
      weeks past. One by one the victims went away and at length Gilmartin left
      the ticker district. He walked slowly down Wall Street, then turned up
      William Street, thinking of his luck. Cosmopolitan Traction had certainly
      looked like higher prices. Indeed, it seemed to him that he could almost
      hear the stock shouting, articulately: &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m going up, right away, right
      away!</i>&rdquo; If somebody would buy a thousand shares and agree to give him
      the profits on a hundred, on ten, on one!
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had not even his carfare. Then he remembered that he had not eaten
      since breakfast. It did him no good to remember it now. He would have to
      get his dinner from Griggs in Brooklyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Gilmartin told himself with a burst of curious self-contempt, &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t even buy a cup of coffee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head and looked about him to find how insignificant a
      restaurant it was in which he could not buy even a cup of coffee. He had
      reached Maiden Lane. As his glance ran up and down the north side of that
      street, it was arrested by the sign:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     MAXWELL &amp; KIP
</pre>
    <p>
      At first he felt but vaguely what it meant. It had grown unfamiliar with
      absence. The clerks were coming out. Jameson, looking crustier than ever,
      as though he were forever thinking how much better than Jenkins he could
      run the business; Danny, some inches taller, no longer an office boy, but
      spick and span in a blue serge suit and a necktie of the latest style,
      exhaling health and correctness; Williamson, grown very gray and showing
      on his face thirty years of routine; Baldwin, happy as of yore at the
      ending of the day&rsquo;s work, and smiling at the words of Jenkins&mdash;Gilmartin&rsquo;s
      successor, who wore an air of authority, of the habit of command which he
      had not known in the old days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden Gilmartin was in the midst of his old life. He saw all that he
      had been, all that he might still be. And he was overwhelmed. He longed to
      rush to his old associates, to speak to them, to shake hands with them, to
      be the old Gilmartin. He was about to step toward Jenkins, but stopped
      abruptly. His clothes were shabby, and he felt ashamed. But, he apologized
      to himself, he could tell them how he had made a hundred thousand and had
      lost it. And he even might borrow a few dollars from Jenkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilmartin turned on his heel with a sudden impulse and walked away from
      Maiden Lane quickly. All that he thought now was that he would not have
      them see him in his plight. He felt the shabbiness of his clothes without
      looking at them. As he walked, a great sense of loneliness came over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was back in Wall Street. At the head of the Street was old Trinity; to
      the right the Sub-Treasury; to the left the Stock Exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Maiden Lane to the Lane of the Ticker&mdash;such had been his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only buy some Cosmopolitan Traction!&rdquo; he said. Then he walked
      forlornly northward, to the great bridge, on his way to Brooklyn, to eat
      with Griggs, the ruined grocery man.
